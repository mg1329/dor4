On  SUNDAY, SIVAN 12, 5683 (May 27th, 1923),
an impressive consecration  ceremony took place at Jerusalem when the
Beth Harav and Synagogue  especially constructed by Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Fischel at their own  expense for Chief Rabbi Kook, was
consecrated. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>  </P> 

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">
The  ceremony was a most brilliant event and

There  were present the elite of the Jewish and
non-Jewish communities and  also a number of American visitors who
then happened to be in  Jerusalem. The gathering was graced by the
attendance of His  Excellency, The High Commissioner and Lady
Samuel. That day will long  be remembered as it afforded, joy and
honor to Mr. and Mrs. Fischel  and rendered spiritual pleasure to the
whole of Orthodox Judaism in  Jerusalem. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">The 
spacious courtyard of the Central Committee Knesseth Israel (Vadd 
Hakloli) was gaily decorated. At the entrance gate there hung a 
bluish-white banner bearing the inscription &quot;Beruchim Haboim&quot; 
(Welcome to the Visitors). On the outside balcony, one observed a 
signboard in gilt letters &quot;Beth Harav and Synagogue built by Mr. 
(Israel Aron) Harry and Mrs. Fischel.&quot; The interior walls of the 
courtyard were covered by blue and white colored bunting and banners 
having inscribed thereon such Biblical verses as &quot;This day hath 
the Eternal appointed, let us be glad and rejoice thereon.&quot; 
&quot;Bless the Lord O House of Israel; bless the Lord O House of 
Aron.&quot; On the wall facing the gathering there hung two pictures, 
one of King George V, and the other of the High Commissioner. 
Immediately beneath these pictures were thirteen tablets in the form 
of Mogen Dovids (Shields of David) with the lettering of the donor's 
name-ISRAEL ARON FISCHEL. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">About 
3:30 P. M. the courtyard was filled to overflowing. The gathering was 
representative of every class and phase of Jerusalem 
Jewry-Ashkenazim, Sefardim, Rabbis, Talmud scholars, business men, 
journalists, teachers-who had all been invited by the Central 
Committee Knesseth Israel to, participate in the consecration 
ceremony. The stairs and balconies were packed with the women of 
Jerusalem who had also come to participate in the day's festivity. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">On 
a specially arranged platform, there sat on plush armchairs the two 
Chief Rabbis, Rabbis Kook and Jacob Meir. The first row of chairs was 
occupied by the American Consul, Mr. Cobb; the Italian Consul, who is 
a neighbor of the Beth Harav; the American visitors now in Jerusalem, 
Messrs. Solomon Lamport, Margareten, Horowitz, Levin, Silversweig, 
and others. Of rabbis there sat on the platform Rabbi Schapiro of

Rabbi Reuben Braz, brother-in-law of Mr. Fischel, Rabbi Joseph Gerson 
Horowitz, Rabbi Harlap; Rabbi Zorah Epstein; Rabbi M. Tibotzinsky;

Colonel Kisch of the Zionist Executive; David Yellin; Dr. Mazie; 
Professor Pick; Dr. Wallach; Dr. Salkind; Mr. Joseph Meyuhas and Mr.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">At 
4 PM. punctually, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Fischel arrived accompanied by 
their son-in-law and daughter, Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein and Mrs. 
Goldstein. They were followed by the Acting Governor of Jerusalem, 
Commander Luke and Mr. Edwin Samuel. The guests were received with 
musical honors. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">Soon 
after, His Excellency, the High Commissioner and Lady Samuel entered 
the courtyard accompanied by aide-de-camp Mr. Cust and Miss Franklin. 
The band of the Blind Institution struck up the National Anthem and 
the whole gathering rose as a mark of respect. The Choir under the 
direction of Cantor Zalmon Rivlin then sang Beruchim Haboim. The High 
Commissioner took his seat between the Chief Rabbis and near Mr. 
Harry Fischel. The proceedings then began. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

SPEECHES </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
</P> 
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">Mr. 
Slutzkin, who presided, opened the consecration ceremony by 
delivering a warm-hearted address. He congratulated Rabbi Kook and 
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Fischel on this auspicious occasion. He expressed 
the hope that the Beth Harav would unite all the forces of the Torah 
and create an impetus for further study and spiritual loftiness. </SPAN></FONT></FONT> 
</P> 
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">Chief 
Rabbi Jacob Meir then rose and in a learned and interesting address, 
dwelt on the Biblical verses &quot;Honor the Lord out of your wealth&quot; 
and &quot;Read not thy sons but thy builders.&quot; &quot;Hitherto,&quot; 
said Rabbi Meir, &quot;Rabbi Kook had to move from place to place and 
house to house, involving many difficulties and inconveniences. By 
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Fischel's munificence, however, Rabbi Kook and 
his, family would now be able to live at ease and comfort in the Beth 
Harav, which had been erected for them. In connection with the Beth 
Harav, a House of Learning had also been built for study and worship 
which would bring honor to the Ashkenazic community.&quot; Rabbi Meir 
warmly shook hands with Rabbi Kook and wished him prosperity. He also 
congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Fischel, terminating his speech, with I 
the wish that &quot;we should all be privileged to witness the 
reconstruction of our National Home, which could be attained only by 
the combination of all forces through union and organization.&quot; </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="he-IL">Rabbi 
Duber Abramowitz of St. Louis, spoke on behalf of the Administration 
of the Vaud Hakloli (Central Committee). He invited Mr. and Mrs. 
Fischel to become inhabitants and citizens of Jerusalem. &quot;Mr. 
Harry Fischel,&quot; he said, &quot;is a great communal worker in 
New. York and he is also treasurer of the Central Relief Committee 
which subvents all the Yeshiboth, Talmud Torahs and Talmudic scholars 
in Palestine. The reconstruction of Palestine is part and parcel of 
his life and the erection of the Beth Harav merits much praise. Other 
institutions looked forward to Mr. Fischel's help, one of these was 
the new building of the Bicur Holim Hospital which was still roofless 
and required completion.&quot; Rabbi Abramowitz then handed the gold 
key of the Beth Harav and Synagogue to Mr. Fischel. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

congratulate the Chief Rabbinate, Mr. and Mrs. Fischel and the Jewish 
Community at large on this auspicious day. Among the many problems 
with which the Civil Administration had to deal on its establishment 
was the adoption of measures to place the Jewish Community both on 
its secular and on its ecclesiastical side, upon a permanent and 
regular basis. The question of the organization of the secular side 
was not yet fully settled. But the government had been able to 
establish, on an electorial basis, the Chief Rabbinate, and for the 
first time after an interval of many centuries, a Jewish 
Ecclesiastical Authority had been founded upon a permanent footing, 
based upon the desires of the community itself. It was fortunate that 
the choice of the community had fallen upon Chief Rabbi Kook and 
Chief Rabbi Meir, who upheld the dignity of the other religious 
communities in Palestine. His Excellency expressed the gratitude that 
was universally felt to Mr. and Mrs. Fischel for the most generous 
gift of the spacious buildings that they were dedicating on that day.

were all aware what was the purpose of the policy of the British 
Government in Palestine in relation to the Jews. That policy had 
been, was now and would remain, the promotion of the establishment of 
a Jewish National Home in Palestine. To that end political action 
must largely contribute. Not less important was the work and 
sacrifices of the Jews themselves. The erection of buildings such as 
these was but an instance of that work. More necessary even than 
bricks and mortar were the numbers of the Jewish population and even 
more important than numbers was their character. Upon the character 
of those who already lived in Palestine and those who came from other 
countries to live there, upon the loftiness of their ideals and the 
soundness of their principles, depended more than on any other factor 
the success of the Jewish National Home. That was the key to 
Palestine. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

He touched on the past of the Jewish people and pointed out that its 
future existence depended on the Torah and its loftiness. He 
mentioned the fact that his father-in-law, Mr. Fischel, had crossed

thanking the donors far their wisdom in choosing such a gift. I 
cannot imagine a finer and more appropriate form of philanthropy for 
Mr. and Mrs. Fischel, in this city, where the demand for decent 
residences is so great. It is undignified for persons occupying 
prominent positions and playing an active role in the people's life, 
to be troubled year in and year out with the housing problem. I hope 
that Mr. and Mrs. Fischel's example will be copied by others. I have 
no doubt that there will arise a Sefardic philanthropist who will 
also build a house for his Chief Rabbi. It is also possible to hope
