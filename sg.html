Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Glasner of Klausenburg (Cluj) in Rumania, was one of
the outstanding Torah authorities of SouthEast Europe during the last, and at the
beginning of the current, century. He was born in Budapest (Hungary) in 1856 (I
Adar 21, 5616) into a rabbinic family. His father, Avraham Glasner, who later
became the rabbi of the city of Klausenburg, was a grandson by marriage of the
world renowned Gaon, the Hatam Sofer.

Moshe Shmuel studied mainly under his father and already in his early youth
gained a reputation as a brilliant Talmudist. He spent but a few months at
Pressburg, during the last days of the author of Ktav 
Sofer, Rabbi Abraham Shmuel Binyamin Sofer.

for truth without any respect for any person" (Introduction to Dor <I>Revi'ee). </I>He
objected strongly to the tendency to introduce pilpulistic reasoning in matters of
Halakhah: (1) "For Pilpul is as far from the path of wisdom as East is from West"
(ibidem); (2) He considered pilpul "a weakness developed in the Galut during
whose millennia of persecutions and migrations our capacity for straight thinking
had been wellnigh destroyed." In this respect he followed in the footsteps of his
great-grandfather, the Hatam Sofer:

"Whilst it is true that the God, in dividing His guidance into the written
and oral Torah, desired every generation to invest its spirit in ever deeper
understanding of our Holy Torah and
its Mitzvot, it is only the people and the sages dwelling in the Holy Land and
there living a complete life undisturbed by foreign influences and alien
tendencies that can achieve this consummation. For it is only through the
holiness of the Jewish people living safely in the Holy Land that Torah can
be transmitted by the perception of its authorities. To them He wanted us to
listen, even though their statements seem (at first) startling.
Such guidance cannot come from our people while scattered among the
nations of the world nor from its scholars, bent under the yoke, physical and
spiritual, of Galut with all the winds of mankind blowing upon them and

After the first World War, when Transsylvania became part of Roumania,
Rabbi Glasner's communal and national work assumed wider scope. His
perception of political realities made him appreciate the profound changes in the
contemporary Jewish world and hence he threw himself with all his energy into
Zionist work. He held that the Balfour Declaration and the new European scene
imposed upon the Jews the obligation to act as a unit and to protect themselves.
The situation in Transsylvania encouraged his project. He became the leader of
Zionism in his country and labored in every sphere of activity. In 1921 he
represented the Mizrachi at the World Congress in Carlsbad; he undertook many
a trip on its behalf.

He had resigned his rabbinical position to settle in Eretz Yisrael. But even
there he could not stay idle. In Jerusalem he continued his work by participating
in various activities. He associated himself enthusiastically with the work for the
religious settlements, then in its infancy. Rabbi Maimon describes how, gazing
upon the wholesome farmers whom the sun of the Holy Land had tanned, Rav
Glasner exclaimed: "It is for such human material that we have prayed: Jews
attached to the soil, upheld by strong, natural national sentiment, free from doubt
or bored disillusionment. These are the types of my brethren whom I love to
meet. Blessed be the Lord Who bestowed that boon upon me."s

<UL>
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
"The main purpose of this work is to show how one should study the
words of our sages, in order to find their true meaning, especially how one
should understand the words of the Rambam (Maimonides), who in most
cases differs with the French scholars in the explanations of Talmudic
subjects, as well as the differences between the explanations of Rashi and
those of the Tosafists. In every place where their explanations differ, the
subject under discussion can be explained in different ways according to
the basic scholarly approach of each one of them . . . . . My main purpose
is to explain the system of the Rambam. Many of us are often puzzled by
his decisions, because we are used to interpret Talmudic subjects according
to the explanations of Rashi and the Tosafists, but we do not realize that
there exists also another way of explaining these subjects, which is the way
of the Rambam."

Another purpose of his work was to clarify in each case of <I>Issur v'Heter
</I>(matters forbidden or allowed), whether the prohibition is Biblical or Rabbinic
<I>(Issur d'Rabbanan o d'Orayta), </I>because it is very important to know in every

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
The Talmud' rules: "The Written Law <I>(Torah Shebiktav) </I>may not be

recited from a written text."

Rabbi Moshe Shmuel offers the following explanation for the prohibition to
write down the Oral Law:
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
"Its purpose was to permit the Torah authorities of later generations to
interpret the Torah and thus to contribute new ideas and thoughts to the field of
Rabbinics. The prohibition, then, served the purpose of developing the Torah
constantly and preventing its being confined to a written text; had the oral Torah
been written, further interpretation would have ceased, because we would have
been bound to the written text."

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
Thus he explains also the problem of Prophecy.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
Our sages said" that the difference between Moses and other prophets in
this respect was that the other prophets spoke in His name: <I>"Koh amar Hashem
- Thus </I>said the Lord" (a general term), whereas Moses proclaimed: <I>"Koh
amar" </I>and <I>"zeh devar" </I>both, "thus" and "this" and <I>"zeh devar Hashem </I>(This is
the word of the Lord)." Rabbi Moshe Shmuel explains that Moses received a
clear detailed task to convey, while other prophets had but the story or contents
of their vision. The instruction Moses received in the Oral Torah consisted of the
contents of Halakhah; he was allowed the freedom of applying his own
reasoning and interpretative powers. This in turn gave Torah authorities of
following generations the same privilege: application of principle or precedent to
new conditions.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
Rabbi Glasner reinforced this argument through another Talmudical saying:
"At first Moses used to study the Torah and forget it until it was presented to
him as a gift." He observes that God's original intention was to convey to Moses
every Halakhah in its final form without any changes. However, He foresaw
the possibility of Moses' forgetting it, hence He changed His original plan"s and
instructed him only in the rules of interpreting the
Torah <I>(Middot ha-Torah) </I>and granted him the right to apply his own reasoning.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
Another example of his approach concerns the laws about Shemittah (the
seventh year of the Sabbath of the land), one of the most complicated halakhic
problems.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
With the first Aliyah the problem arose as to whether the law of Shemittah,
the obligation to let the land lie fallow every seventh year, was for our times
(after the destruction of the holy temple of Jerusalem) biblical or rabbinic. The
greatest Torah authorities wrestled with it. The gist of this question centered
around whether Shemittah being in our time merely a rabbinic ordinance, would
hence permit a sale of the land through <I>Shtar Mekhirah </I>to a nonJew. If its
validity was biblical, a formal sales contract would be questionable. Rabbi
Glasner offered a simple, original answer:
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
The Mitzvah of Shemitah, he argued, is linked together with the promise:10
<I>"And 1 will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall
bring forth produce for the three years." </I>Since we do not witness the
realization of this promise in our times (the law being conditional), the exemption
of Shemittah is selfevident.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
His attitude towards the problems of our time is expressed in his book
"Zionism in the Light of Religion," published in 1920. Its central point is the
sovereignty of the Torah based on the national existence of the Jewish people on
its own soil, the indispensible condition for its natural wholesome development
both, physical and spiritual.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
He opposed the orthodox community in Hungary which in its struggle against
religious reform "stressed only the eternality of the unchangeable Law without
sufficiently emphasizing the dangers of assimilationist trends," which the will to
national existence opposes with full force. The orthodox group would not assert
that the national hope and faith in the Restoration of Zion alone represented the
preserving power of Jewish life in the Golah. Rav Glasner took his
uncompromising stand: "The very laws of the Torah testify to their national
character, the very order of the Mitzvot represent a system of national
foundations." He was first among the great Torah authorities to recognize the
need for a new basic emphasis in Jewish thought: towards the return of an
independent Jewish government in Israel. At the 12th Zionist Congress in
Carlsbad he urged the restoration of the Sanhedrin.
To him Law and Zionism are meant to forge the people and the land into organic
unity.

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
With regard to the grave cultural problem <I>(Kulturproblem) </I>in Zionism he held
that the Mizrachi, as its religious partner, ought to inspire the whole movement
with the brightness of TorahJudaism. To deprive Zionism of spiritual endeavor
would mean to <I>"destroy its soul while the body still </I>exists." One cannot build up
Israel without faith, or dynamic spiritual effort. Whatever will make Israel
flourish, every productive enterprise possesses "a quality of sanctity."

normally contradictory. He that possesses the power to refrain, does not possess
the power of zeal. However, our people by complying with the Torah
demonstrate the ability of harmonizing the two seemingly opposite qualities.
