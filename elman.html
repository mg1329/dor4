RABBI MOSES SAMUEL GLASNER:
THE ORAL TORAH </font>
<P align="justify">
Rabbi Moses Samuel Glasner (1856-1924), an only son of Rabbi Avraham
Glasner and a great-grandson of the Hatam Sofer through his mother,
Raizel (a daughter of the Hatam Sofer's oldest daughter Hindel), was
born in Pressberg, and later moved with his family to Klausenburg,
where his father served as rabbi. The younger Glasner succeeded his
father as rabbi in 1878, serving in that capacity until his move to
Jerusalem in 1923. In Jerusalem, he was involved in Mizrachi
educational activities during the last year-and-a-half of his life.
<P>
Despite his lineage, in the main he led an embattled life in the
sectarian politics of Hungarian Jewry, as he himself writes in the
introduction to his bestknown work, <i>Dor Revi'i (hiddushim</i> on Hulin,
Klausenburg,1921). First of all, he was a leader and spokesman of
Mizrachi who did not forbear from attacking its Orthodox opponents, as
he did in his address before its founding convention in Pressburg in
1904. Second, his independent style of learningwith its stress on
Rishonim (understood on their own terms), opposition to <i>pilpul</i> and
emphasis on the sovereignty of critical thought-way looked upon with
disfavor.<sup>1</sup> He himself emphasizes that, aside from a few months spent
with the Ketav Sofer, his primary and only teacher was his father.2
<P>
Aside from his <i>hiddushim</i> on Hulin, he published a collection of
responsa, <i>Dor Revi'i, Shevivei Esh</i> on the Torah and sugyot, <i>Or
ha-Bahir</i> on Hilkhot Miqva'ot, <i>Halakhah le-Moshe</i> on <i>shehitah</i>, and
more. Other works remain unpublished.
<P>
The following is a translation of parts of his Introduction to <i>Dor
Revi'i</i> on Hulin, which sets forth Rabbi Glasner's view of the role of
the Oral Torah within the history of Kelal Yisrael. His emphasis on
the progressive development of Jewish law is similar in certain
respects to aspects of the thought of R. Kook<sup>3</sup> and R. Zadok ha-Kohen
of Lublin,<sup>4</sup> but Rabbi Glasner's schema is less overtly historical than
that of the latter, and more halakhic and less mystical than that of
the former.<sup>5</sup>
<P>
<font size="+1">
May the Creator of Light and Fashioner of Darkness be blessed and
exalted for ever and ever, for the Lord made these [two coordinate
forces]<sup>6</sup> in order [for humans] to make a name for themselves
[<i>lehitgadder</i>] by means of them,<sup>7</sup> to distinguish and separate between
Light and Darkness, between Truth and Falsehood. This is the [purpose]
of man as long as he lives upon earth<sup>8</sup>-to pursue and seek that which is
hidden, faroff and veiled from him; this desire is his function, and
his function is the essence of his life. This is true of a man who is
full of materialistic desires as well of as one who wishes to fill his
soul with intellectual knowledge and spiritual pursuits. For the life
of one who achieves his desire and has no other is no life, and his
days are days in which he has no pleasure.<sup>9</sup> For the essence of life,
which vivifies all creation, is the intense desire for that which lies
beyond him, which is difficult to attain; no man dies accomplishing
half of what he desires.<sup>10</sup> . . . Perhaps this is that what Hazal meant
when they interpreted the verse "God saw how good the light was and
divided"<sup>11</sup>--that He hid it away for the righteous in Messianic times,
viz., that this light will always be hidden from the eyes of the
righteous [in order that] they should seek to attain it.12 In this
they will find [their] life's pleasures and the merit of their
existence, in raising themselves to a high [spiritual and
intellectual] level, striving hungrily for higher and higher degrees
of understanding in this world of action<sup>13</sup>
"which God created to do...."<sup>14</sup>
<P>
As the <i>'Iqqarim</i> interpreted "Generation after generation will praise
Your works,"
<sup>15</sup> [viz.,] a person improves God's works by his
innovations, wonders that his predecessors never imagined;<sup>16</sup>
regarding such things the expression "to do" is most appropriate
.... For just as in natural science a person produces innovations with
his intelligence and understanding based on old principles, so too
with the science of our holy Torah. As Hazal say, "if you hear the
old, you will hear the new."<sup>17</sup> The intent is that one who incessantly
occupies himself with the Torah that is with us of old and "kills
himself over it"<sup>18</sup> can derive totally new insights which were never
[apprehended] before;<sup>19</sup> it is in this sense that Hazal said that "the
Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moses all that an experienced disciple
would in future times innovate [in Torah],"<sup>20</sup> for all that is destined
to be innovated in Torah was inherent <i>in potentia</i> [from the beginning]
.... Even though the Torah was given complete [<i>hatumah</i>]<sup>21</sup> and one is
forbidden to add to it or subtract from it, and Hazal derived from
"These are the commandments "<sup>22</sup> [the principle] that from that time
[of the completion of the Torah as described in Deut. 31:24-26, even]
a prophet may not innovate anything<sup>23</sup>--this refers only to adding to,
or subtracting from it, but permission is given to every authorized
court [of ordained sages] to interpret it and derive new laws. This
too is similar to the Creation, for though no human has the ability to
create <i>ex nihilo</i>, he [has the ability] by combining separate [already
existent] forces and elements to provide a hidden internal
combination. Creation and the Torah are similar in this; the only
difference is that while Creation was given to all mankind to
manipulate, the Torah was given only to the Chosen People, the
Israelites; it is ours, to love and perfect, to mediate on it with
selfsacrifice in order to attain the light in it that will reveal to
us new lights which give content to our spiritual lives.
<P>
And these are the words of the Rambam: "[If] the Great Court derived
[a law] by one of the hermeneutical principles according to what they
deem correct, and after them a new court arose to reverse [that law],
[that later court] may reverse the law and rule as they deem correct,
as [Scripture] says: `to the judge that will be in those days'
<sup>24</sup>--you
need only consult the court in your own time" (Hilkhot Mamrim
2:1). [Regarding this] we learnt in [Mishnah] Eduyot<sup>25</sup> that this Great
Court must be greater in wisdom and number in order to reverse the
decision of its predecessors-that applies only to the matter of
decrees and regulations, but not in the interpretation of Torah, as
the Rambam explains in 2:2. Now, the Kesef Mishneh there asks how
then, according to the Rambam, could the Talmud raise a difficulty
against a statement of an Amora from a mishnah or baraita, to the
point of reconciling the two by suggesting that [the Amoral held the
view of one Tanna [and not the view of the one represented by the
mishnah or baraita], or [how could the Talmud] otherwise leave it as a
refutation [against the statement of the Amora]--- not answer that
[the Amoral merely disagrees [with the other Tanna], since permission
is given to later generations to disagree with earlier ones? He
answers: "It is possible that from the time of the closing of the
Mishnah later generations took upon themselves [the rule] not to
dispute [the view of] earlier generations, and so too in the case of
the closing of the Talmud, for from the day of its sealing no one has
the right to dispute it[s decisions]." But we must note that if the
Kesef Mishnah is correct, how is it that this great and awesome
matter-a matter which is the founding principle of halakhic
decision-making, viz., they took it upon themselves not to dispute the
Mishnah, and later they took it upon themselves not to dispute a
Talmudic source-is not mentioned in either the Babylonian or
Palestinian Talmud; there is apparently no hint of this!
<P>
. . . Know that the clearest and most essential difference between the
Written and Oral Torahs is that while the Written Torah was handed
over to Moses word by word from "In the beginning" to "before the eyes
of all Israel," the content of Oral Torah was given over but not the
words. Regarding this Hazal have said that "all the prophets
prophesied with the expression thus said the Lord,' but Moses [was
greater than they in that] he added an expression-[he prophesied] with
`thus' and `this is the word',"<sup>26</sup> viz., [all the other] prophets
received only the content [of their prophecies from God], and this is
"thus said God," but Moses prophesied with "thus" and "this is the
word," i.e., the Written Torah with "this is the word" and the Oral
Torah with "thus said God." [He handed over] the Written Torah word by
word just as he received it, and the Oral Torah in his own words,
according to the content. This is what Hazal meant: "No two prophets
prophesy with the same signet [= exact wording],"<sup>27</sup> viz., the same
exact prophecy, each one in his own style and language. Even if we
accept the Malbim's view in his introduction to [his commentary on]
Jeremiah, that all the words of the prophets are the word of God which
He placed in their mouths word by word and the differences in style
[among them] are by the will of God, it is clear that the Oral Torah
was not given word by word, for exact wording must be transmitted in
writing, as we all truly observe, for [only] the content of the
traditions that date back to Moses (<i>halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>) were
handed down [and not their exact wording]. Our teacher Moses handed
over to us what he understood of the tradition received at Sinai. Now
any matter which is transmitted orally will be the very nature of [its
transmission] be subject to change in interpretation [as it goes] from
person to,person, for everyone injects into it something of his own
understanding . . . . For this reason [Hazal] invalidated the
testimony of a witness at second remove, for the [latter] will not
remember the words [he had heard] but [only] the[ir general] content,
and pass it on to a third person according to his understandingand the
testimony can easily become distorted . . . , for human sensibilities
are never identical.
<P>
Thus, whoever has due regard for the truth will conclude that the
reason the [proper] interpretation of the Torah was transmitted orally
and forbidden to be written down<sup>28</sup> was <i>not</i> to make [the Torah]
unchanging and not to tie the hands of the sages of every generation
from interpreting Scripture according to their understanding. Only in
this way can the eternity of Torah be understood [properly], for the
changes in the generations and their opinions, situation and material
and moral condition requires changes in their laws, decrees and
improvements.<sup>29</sup> Rather, the truth is that this [issues from] the
wonderful wisdom [and] profound insight of the Torah, [which teaches]
that the interpretation of Torah [must be] given over to the sages of
each generation in order that the Torah remain a living force with the
nation, developing with it, and that indeed is its eternity. In this
way may we understand correctly the wording of the blessing "Who gave
us a Torah of truth and implanted in us eternal life," which the Tur
interprets as follows: "a Torah of truth" refers to the Written Torah
and "eternal life" refers to the Oral Torah (Orah Hayyim 138, see
Shulhan Arukh thereto). This can well be understood in light of what
we have said: Written Torah can be called "truth" because it is
absolutely true. No additions or subtractions can be made to or from
it, and thus it is transmitted in written form, and a Torah scroll
which is missing one letter is invalid for use. The Oral Torah, its
interpretation, however, is not called absolute truth, but rather
conventional truth which depends on the "judge in your days" [i.e.,
based on the agreement of the sages].<sup>30</sup> For this very reason, though,
it is called "eternal life implanted within us," for in it enters the
living spirit of every generation of human endeavor, and thus it is
called "eternal life."
<P>
In order to give authority to the sages of the Torah of every
generation, and in order that the nation not be divided into different
sects, the Torah commanded the <i>parashah</i> of a rebellious elder,' and
this is the explanation of the Hinnukh (mitzvah 496): "[It is written]
`do not turn . . . right or left [from all that {the judges of your
time} tell you]'<sup>32</sup>--even if they are in error in one matter, it is not
fitting for us to dispute them, but we must act according to their
error. It is better to bear one error and remain under their authority
than to have each one follow his own ideas, for in that lies the
destruction of religion, the division of the nation and its complete
annihilation."
<P>
The Rambam makes a similar point in his commentary on the Torah: "If
it should occur to you that [the sages] are mistaken, and the matter
is as simple to you as right and left, [nevertheless,] follow their
instructions; do not say: How can I eat this forbidden fat? or: How
can I murder this innocent man [who has been condemned to death by a
properly constituted court]? Rather, say: So did the Lord Who
commanded the mitzvot command . . . and according to their opinion did
He give the Torah, even if they err."<sup>33</sup>
<P>
[The author of] <i>Midirash Shmuel</i><sup>34</sup> on Ethics of the Fathers (chapter 1,
s.v. "Make a fence for the Torah") makes the same point in this way:
"And therefore [the Tanna] says that this Torah was handed over to
Joshua<sup>35</sup> to do with it as he wished, making right left and left right
<i>according to the time</i> and place [R. Glasner's emphasis]; in all this
it is his, to do with as he wishes, and so too was it handed over to
the Elders, etc.<sup>36</sup> <i>and this is one of the reasons that the Oral Torah
was not written down but given to the Great Court to do with as it
wished</i> [R. Glasner's emphasis]."
<P>
Thus you see clearly that although the Orah Torah was given over to
Moses at Sinai, since it was not given word for word but only the
contents [were given], and it was not permitted to be written down,
this indicates that the will of the One Who commanded, may He be
blessed, was <i>not</i> to make the interpretation of Torah unchanging, in
order that there should not appear an open contradiction between life
and the Torah. This is what the Talmud answers regarding the
question-if there is substance to the Oral Torah, why was it not
written down? The answer given is because of the verse "of making
books there is no end,"<sup>37</sup> viz., it would then be necessary to write a
new and different interpretation for every time, according to the
needs of the time and place, and that is why the Oral Torah is called
"new," <i>38</i> for the Oral Torah is not absolute truth but rather
conventional. Only that which the sages of the generation agree upon
is true [in this sense]. When they contradict that which was [accepted
as true until then, their new interpretation becomes the true one [for
their generation]; so have we been commanded by Him, may He be
blessed, that we "should not depart from the thing (the sages of that
generation) tell us either to the right or left"<sup>39</sup>
--even if they uproot
that which was agreed upon until now. This too is what they intended
when they said "Both these and these are the word of the Living God
. . . ."<sup>40</sup>
<P>
And this is the Rambam's intent that I quoted above. He is of the
opinion that every court in its generation, though it is not greater
than its precedessor, but inferior to it, has the right to disagree
and interpret and expound Scripture according to its understanding and
according to the principles agreed upon by the sages, handed down from
Moses at Sinai . . . and even the court of Joshua was able to dispute
the court of our teacher Moses in interpreting and expounding the
Torah. However, while this opinion of the Rambam's is the essential
law, in accordance with the verse "the judge that will be in those
days," it is really a law for Messianic times (<i>hilkheta
li-meshiha</i>). For [when] the Temple is rebuilt (speedily in our
times!), and the "children return to their boundary,"<sup>41</sup> and the crown
is returned to its former condition in that the Oral Torah will be
transmitted orally and it will be forbidden to write it down-then the
sages of each generation will have the right to interpret the Torah
[according to their own understanding] without reference to the
interpretations of their predecessors, for the Oral Torah will not
have been written down in an "iron pen" to be unchanging. But from the
time that Rabbenu Haqadosh and the sages of his generation uprooted
the prohibition of writing down matters hitherto transmitted orally,<sup>42</sup>
it is obvious that it is forbidden to us to dispute what generations
before us have set down in writing in order to remain authoritative
for many days.<sup>43</sup> The intent of permitting the writing down of oral
traditions was to prevent later generations from disputing the views
of their predecessors. Only in this way may we understand the great
controversy surrounding the permissibility of writing [oral
traditions], to the point that [the sages of the Talmud] said that
whoever writes down halakhot is as one who burns them (Temurah
14b). But they held that it is better to uproot [part of] the Torah<sup>44</sup>
than the Torah be forgotten by Israel.

1. "Know that after thousands of years of exile and wanderings have
passed over us, [these persecutions] have killed our (capacity] for
logical thinking and the power of critical thought, and has given
birth to the way of <i>pilpul</i> which is far from the way of wisdom as the
east is from the west" (Introduction to <i>Dor Revi'i</i>, p. 3c). Or: "If
one man be found who wishes to remove the thorns and weed the
[garden], he is adjudged a rebellious elder, and, God forbid, as one
who cuts down the shoots" [= a heretic]. In this way the land is
filled with hypocritical flattery in which [each one] suppresses [his
sincere] opinions because of the power of those who are willing to use
force and intimidation against whoever opposes them" (ibid., p. 4a).

5. Rabbi Glasner is reticent about the sources of his view of the
development of Jewish lass. and the extent of the influence of Rav
Kooks or R. Zadok's thoughts cannot as yet be gauged. R. Zadok's
<i>Resisei Laylah</i> (Lublin, 1902/3) which contains much of his
historiosophy, was available for nearly two decades before publication
of <i>Dor Revi'i</i>. As to Rav Kook, the earliest known correspondence
between them dates from Rabbi Glasner's arrival in Jerusalem in 1922,
the year after publication of <i>Dor Revi'i</i>, and does not touch on these
issues (see <i>Iggerot ha-Re'iyah</i> IV Jerusalem. 1983/4, pp. 132, n. 1139
(dated 6 Av 56820; nor does a letter ofcondolence addressed to his son
Rabbi Akiba Glasner, who succeeded him in Klausenburg, pp. 215-216
