<B>STRUCK, HERMANN </B>(1876-1944), graphic artist. Struck, born
into an Orthodox Berlin family, studied at the Berlin Academy under
Max Koner, where Hans Meyer introduced him to the art of etching.
Struck joined the Zionist movement at an early age. In 1903, after
several study trips throughout Europe, he visited Palestine and, on his
way back to Germany, stopped in Vienna and met Herzl. This meeting
inspired the famous portrait etching of the Zionist leader. During World
War I Struck served with the German army in Lithuania. There he came
in contact with East European Jews and was deeply impressed by their
way of life.

Palestine and settled in Haifa. Struck's favorite technique was copper
etching and its related processes although he did lithographs as well. His
early work, done in pure etching, was usually signed with his Hebrew
name, Hayyim Aharon ben David. From 1902 he mixed etching with

technical explanations and practical instruction. Struck excelled as a
portraitist. Among his sitters were Ibsen, Nietzsche, Freud, and Einstein.
He also did
landscapes, Jewish types and scenes from Jewish life as well
as many ex libris. Struck, who remained an Orthodox Jew,  
participated in Jewish public life and attended several
Zionist congresses as one of the leaders of the Mizrachi
Party. He was a member of the London Society of Painters,
Etchers and Engravers.
