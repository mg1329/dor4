<FONT SIZE=3>	Since the appearance of Herzl's movement, which aroused
Judaism from its slumber with its call to self-help, many have dealt
with the question whether it is appropriate to view Judaism in its
dispersion among the nations and its association with them as a
nationality unto itself.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	For the Gentile the question does not even exist.  To
the cobbler who utters the epithet Yid as a matter of course and to
the enlightened Christian who imposes, in a polite fashion, social
and economic ostracism upon the Jew, or treats him, at any rate, as
one without equal rights, it is clear that the Jew, because of his
special inherited traits, his manners and traditions, must be
perceived and endured as a pin in the raw flesh of the nations.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It is appropriate to note that in discussing this
question, the two opposite extremes in Judaism - the assimilationists
on one side and those called &quot;Hareidim&quot; on the other - come
together to oppose, each for its own reasons and motives, the
awakened national feeling.  The assimilationists do not believe in
the future of Judaism and they are tied to it only by a cultural
connection:   this connection is satisfied with a visit to the temple
during the High Holy Days and the memorial days, while in all areas
of life they do not differ fundamentally from the Christians.  They
therefore can not understand what offense the Gentile society has
found in them and why they are not treated as equal citizens.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	With the assimilationists there is nothing to discuss,
for they have become estranged and are very far removed from Judaism.
 In an outward way, as in their inward aspiration, they see
themselves as part of the governing nationality.  It is therefore
regrettable that Christian society does not honor their ways and
observes in them foreign characteristics whose existence the
assimilationists deny completely.  This situation often results in
baptism.  Especially now at the </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0; page-break-before: always">
<FONT SIZE=3>moment of the reawakening of the national feeling of
Israel and the strengthening of its aspiration for national
independence, it is shocking to witness this outcome.  In this
circumstance, our assimilationists are confused and see apostasy as
their only alternative.  We do, indeed, regret that the birth of the
national idea in Israel is hastening the pace of separation from the
people.  However, there is in this ultimately no loss for the revival
of Judaism, for the assimilationist principle within us always posed
a danger to the survival of the Jewish community.  And when, over
fifty years ago, we witnessed a similar process of separation between
the Orthodox and the Neologs, it was really the aspiration for
assimilation that was the hidden impetus for that separation.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Those who were somewhat Hareidi and those who were not
Hareidi at all were confused by the onset of Emancipation, for they
believed that they discerned in the Emancipation the complete
redemption, the redemption of Israel, for which they had been hoping
and praying.  They thought that, with the formal removal of the walls
of the ghetto, the spiritual walls between Jews and Gentiles had also
been destroyed.  The spirit of Israel would be able to work
successfully in all areas of life: in the arts, in science and in
literature.  The end of the Diaspora had come.  Within this view lay
a serious danger to the survival of faithful Judaism or of the
survival of Judaism of any kind.  There was no way to confront this
danger but that of separation.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	But here a serious mistake was made.  The separation
was based on a religious distinction.  They tried to prove that
between the Orthodox and the Neologs there were dogmatic differences
that did not allow them to coexist.  But they hid the true reason for
the separation that was contained in the assimilationist tendency of
the reformist movement, Neologism, and that the survival of the
Jewish nation required the most determined opposition to this
movement.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Loyal Jews did not have the courage to announce and
declare the simple truth that the Judaism that survived the two
thousand year Diaspora, undergoing the most difficult trials through
the strength of the unqualified faith in the true redemption that
would bring to full realization the national life of the Jewish
nation on the holy land of Israel, was not prepared to abandon its
hope in exchange for an emancipation on paper that had not, in fact,
been realized at all or in part.  Orthodoxy was too timid not to
agree that the emancipation - on the assumption that its intention
was to disperse the nation among the host countries - was not useful
or desirable inasmuch as we had not abandoned the hope for a full
national life in the Holy Land.  Orthodoxy, thus, clothed itself in
the cloak of patriotism and began to compete with Neologism in a
contest of chauvinism.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The final achievement of the national association of
Orthodoxy in Budapest is typical of the conduct of the Orthodox
leadership.  With the collapse of the Great Powers in October 1918 it
was announced that it was necessary to call a national assembly for
the sake of demonstrating support for the demand for a unified
Hungarian state.  The Neolog leaders, Ferenc Szekely and Vilmos
Vazsonyi, gathered the Jewish communities, without any partisan
distinction, to a convention in Budapest, so that Hungarian Jews,
Hungarians of the Mosaic faith, would express their opinion in favor
of a unified state.  The leadership of the Orthodox announced in an
official message, that it viewed the proclamation as redundant, even
dangerous.  The proclamation could be interpreted to mean that there
was some special necessity for the Jews of Hungary to declare that
they were full Hungarians, whereas for members of other faiths the
matter was self-evident.  In a critical period, when the great powers
of the world recognized the right of every nation, and, in
particular, of the Jewish nation, to national independence, the
official Orthodox leadership continued to maintain this shameful lie,
as if the Jews were only a separate religious community (Hungarians
of the Mosaic faith), but, as a people, were, like the Catholics or
the Protestants,  complete Hungarians.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	And what happened a few months later when upper Hungary
joined Czechoslovakia?  Here the Orthodox organized itself in the
spirit of the old Hungarian Orthodoxy.  It proclaimed itself a
separate religious community and it allowed its national status to be
decided by the government.  The same people that took a key position
in Hungarian Orthodoxy and issued in its name the above proclamation,
now announced to the President of Czechoslovakia that they were
seeking only protection for the autonomy of the religious Jewish
community, awaiting the future determination of their nationality,
while being indifferent about whether they would be classified as
Czechoslovaks or Hungarians.  The President of the state, of course,
denied their request decisively, as we read in the Israelit (July
1919, p. 27).  What will the Czechoslovak government say and what
will the Hungarian government say concerning this playing with the
most sacred feelings of national sentiment?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	In light of what has been said it would be unnecessary
to prove that those who are called Hareidim deny their Jewish
nationality for political reasons, as it were, and in so doing they
cooperate with the assimilationists.  The truth is that the Jewish
people is a nation that, like every other nation, has national
aspirations.  It is therefore necessary to seek the origins of the
falsehood that we are just a religious community.  It will not be
redundant then if I say a few words here on the subject &quot;faith&quot;
or &quot;nation&quot; from a religious and philosophical point of
view.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Whoever says that the Torah prescribes only a religious
law or a faith makes a fundamental error.  The Torah is a civil law,
and, at bottom, it is the condition for the national existence and
the national state.  The purpose of the first commandment that our
father Abraham was commanded, circumcision, was to apply a mark that
would distinguish the descendants of Abraham from all other peoples. 
The Sabbath, which is &quot;a sign between Me and between the
children of Israel&quot; (Exodus 31:13) is the national property of
the Jewish people.  That is why our Sages said: &quot;A Gentile that
observes the Sabbath is liable to the death penalty&quot; (Sanhedrin
58a).  The Gentile, who is not from the children of Israel, commits a
capital offense by observing the Sabbath.  Almost all the other
commandments are tied to historical events, for example: hameitz and
matzah, the pascal sacrifice, tephilin, redemption of the first born,
gid ha-nasheh and the like.  Many of them are tied to living on the
land, for example Sukkot (Deuteronomy 16:13:  &quot;when you make
your ingathering from your granary and winepress&quot;), the four
species from the vegetation of the land, Shavuot at the time of the
wheat harvest, the Omer on Pesach to permit consumption of the newly
harvested grain within the boundaries of the land, the twin loaves on
Shavuot and all the commandments that are dependent on the land of
Israel, orlah, k'lai ha-kerem, shemitah, yoveil, t'rumot and
ma'aserot, the appointment of judges and officers (See Ramban,
poroshat Shoftim) and other similar commandments.  Similarly the
various commandments concerning the bringing of sacrifices are all
based on the assumption of the existence of a land of our own, the
land of Israel.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The Ramban writes in poroshat Va-ethanan and in

charge&quot; that the commandments principally apply on the land, as
is implied by the plain meaning of numerous verses.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>	My holy ancestor the Hatam Sofer z.l., writes in his
responsum at the end of Yoreh Dei'ah that he  wondered how the Rambam
established belief in the coming of the Messiah as a fundamental
tenet of faith, so that if the foundation falls, so does the entire
structure.  For are we not enjoined to observe the commandments even
if we should we never return to our land?  (See Hatam Sofer, Yoreh
Dei'ah, 356)<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
Now, though I am dust beneath the feet of my holy ancestor, of
blessed memory, I have written at length in a responsum that, with
apologies to the honor of his learning, he was carried away and
forgot the words of the Ramban mentioned above which he himself cites
in his commentary on Gittin concerning one who sold his slave to a
master outside the land of Israel in which case the slave goes free,
because fulfilling the commandments outside the land of Israel is
considered a nullity inasmuch as one who dwells outside the land of
Israel resembles one who has no G-d, since, as the Ramban wrote, the
principal application of the commandments is in the land of Israel 
(Hidushei Hatam Sofer, Gittin 8a).  This is the upshot of his
explanation.  It is, therefore, certainly a great and awesome tenet
of faith to believe that we will return to the land of our fathers,
for only there in the capacity of a free nation (am hophshi)
inhabitants of the land shall we be able to develop and to become a
wise and understanding people and a kingdom of priests and holy
nation.  Nor, as I have explained in my responsum, is his question
concerning the ten tribes difficult at all.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It is clear, then, that anyone who does not believe in
the future of the Jewish people in its historical homeland twists the
Torah from its plain meaning.  That is why when a Gentile comes to
convert to Judaism he must first pledge solidarity  with the Jewish
people, as in the words of Ruth the Moabite: &quot;Your people shall
be my people, and your G-d my G-d&quot; (Ruth 1:16).  My opinion,
then, is that the proclamation that it is possible to belong to the
Jewish faith while also belonging to the Hungarian, German, or Slavic
nationalities is absolute heresy and that the prohibition against
such heresy is of such severity that one is obligated to be killed
rather than to transgress (yei'hareig v'al ya'avor).  I therefore
cannot understand how our rabbis, the leaders of the Hungarian
Orthodox Jewish community could have officially announced that the
Orthodox Jews uphold Judaism as a religious community, but that they
have nothing to do with the Judaism as a nationality, that they see
themselves as Hungarians of the first rank and perceive no
distinction between themselves and the ethnic Hungarians except their
religion.  In the annals of the Jewish people this proclamation will
remain as a disgraceful, indelible stain on Hungarian Orthodoxy.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It is wrong to see the Torah as a simple religious law
for the following reason: all obligatory religions stand on the
foundation that they alone entitle a person to reward and they
therefore aspire to gather to themselves the hearts of all mankind,
whereas the Torah of Israel, the law of a national state, excludes
members of other nationalities from the group that must fulfill its
religious laws while also admitting that not only the Jewish religion
grants reward but that everyone who believes in the Master of the
Universe and fulfills the Seven Noahide Laws can be rewarded.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It seems to me that I have said enough about the
question whether we are a nation or a religious community.  The
discussion can be summarized in a short sentence:  We are a people
with national aspirations, to a land of our own and a language of our
own, and if we ceased to be so, or if we relinquished our
nationality, we should cease to be a religious community.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The highest criterion of an authentic religion is a
supreme religious authority, which in Judaism is found only in the
land of Israel and by virtue of the semiha (ordination).  Whatever
has been established in this area in the Diaspora is only a temporary
expedient.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>III. 	<I>The Influence of Zionism on the Faith</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	With everything that we have said until here, we have
still not dispelled the suspicions of the Hareidim about the
resurrection of  national awareness and about revival of national
life in the land of Israel.  The fear is great and not unfounded and
therefore is worthy of serious discussion from the halakhic
standpoint.  I approach this inquiry with a prayer for Heavenly
assistance that He will help me prove the righteousness of the
matters to those Hareidim whose hearts are open to understanding and
to thoughtful discussion.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	No one is unaware of the greatness of the commandment
of settling the land of Israel, for whose upkeep the greatest of the
heros dedicated their best thoughts and deeds and for the sake of
which they permitted the writing of a bill of sale on the Sabbath. 
Nor has it been hidden from anyone's eyes that this Sabbath, this the
most important of the commandment of our holy Torah, can only be
observed in the Diaspora by pushing aside the private economic
concerns of the individual, and it is therefore violated by many for
the sake of survival and sustenance.  It is not so in the land of
Israel within which the Sabbath day is securely designated as an
official day of rest.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Nevertheless, the Hareidim see in the renewal of the
national life in Israel a danger to the traditional religion.  First,
because the direction and active leadership are in the hands of
people who are not reliable from a religious standpoint, in the hands
of those who do not recognize the fundamental religious tenets and
who are not prepared to be guided in their actions by religious
considerations.  Second, because it is impossible to imagine a
renewed political order, supported by its economic and cultural
institutions, that would be founded upon religion and tradition while
also satisfying the requirements of the renewed settlement of the
land of Israel.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	However, there is another fear that worries the
Hareidim and arouses their doubts about the rebirth of Israel in the
land of Israel.  It is well known that in the course of two thousand
years of exile it was only the involvement in and the study of the
Torah that preserved Israel.  All that time, while the ghetto was
separating the Jews from the world of business and culture, the
fields of art and science, craftsmanship and agriculture, it was
natural that the Jews would devote themselves with all their
intellectual talent, to the study of Torah.  Concentration on the
Torah was the sole ideal of the people.  The honor, glory and favor
of the town were directed toward the Torah scholar, and to a lesser
degree, toward an ignorant person who supported a Torah scholar with
his own wealth.  Indeed, even after the walls of the ghetto were
brought down and all fields of activity were opened to the eyes of
the Jews, the people thought it proper to confine their youth within
in the four walls of the &quot;heder&quot; and the house of study,
because every other activity, which is profane and not specifically
Jewish, would distance one from Judaism.  Whoever turned his back on
the house of study - whatever his talent in any other field might be
- was absolutely or partly lost to the Jewish people and was not
entitled to the glory of a Jewish person.  Only one who studied the
Torah was thought to be a specifically Jewish person, and even this
study had to be on condition that it was undertaken only for the sake
of Heaven, without any special objective and not in a scientific or
philosophical manner.  For the sake of an elevated safeguard on the
religious spirit of study, Scriptural and linguistic study were
pushed aside into the corner.  Matters reached the point that many
rabbis had only a weak idea concerning the history of their nation
and could not write a single line on paper without committing gross
errors.  Instead of following the dictate (&quot;at five years begin
the study of the Scriptures, at ten the study of the Mishnah, and at
fifteen the study of the Talmud&quot;) of the Tanna in Pirkei Avot
(5:21), which implies that the first five years of study should be
reserved for the study of the Holy Scriptures, to gaining mastery
over the language and to breathing in the spirit of the prophets, and
according to which a child should only be inducted at the age of ten
into the hall of study of the Mishnaic literature, and at the age of
fifteen to the higher study of the Talmud a doctrine was created that
makes a mockery of all the rules of pedagogy and twists the minds of
the best spiritual power.  Here in the Diaspora they saw the need to
skip the rungs of the ladder and to force the child at age of six
into the house of the Talmud.  Against this doctrine, or more
correctly, against this absence of doctrine, warnings were issued by
the holy Shelah, R. Ya'akov Emden, and by other great scholars. 
Nevertheless, the doctrine became deeply rooted and it rules today in
the Hareidi world.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The revival of the national life in the land of Israel
is now being discussed.  In that land, work in all fields of human
activity will merit its proper valuation, and the study of Torah will
there cease to be the only field in which it is possible to work for
the sake of Judaism.  The physician, the engineer, the chemist, the
farmer and the artist - all these will perform Jewish work that will
bring upon itself honor and glory.  Will none of those young people
who have sat until now on the benches of the heder and the house of
study, without doctrine or purpose, not be drawn into these fields? 
And will none of them turn to new fields by which to serve their
people with their full physical and intellectual capabilities?  What
will happen to the Torah?  What then will happen to those houses of
study, hallowed to this day?  And will any of those few that will
continue to be eager to study Torah continue to study in the
customary manner?  Will any of the nation that has renewed itself in
the land of Israel, the generation that will speak classical Hebrew,
recognize as spiritual leaders those Torah scholars, those
Yiddish-speaking yeshiva instructors who do not speak the language of
their people?  Will any of the new Jews listen to their
incomprehensible speeches and lectures?  And if the Jewish circles
will be forced to change the manner of instruction in the schools and
yeshivot, will the change not damage the religious spirit that has
thus far governed these institutions?  And will this spirit not be
transformed into a spirit of research, science and haskalah?  These
thoughts are what frighten the Hareidim and are precisely what has
changed them into absolute opponents of the aspirations of a tortured
people to gain for itself the natural right to live, as it wills, in
its homeland. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	In response to these fears, it is my wish to explain my
position.  There are two responses.  First, do we Hareidim, who have,
to our misfortune, become a minority in the Jewish people, and
especially weak in intellectual and material powers, really think
that through our passive opposition, or through our Agudah groups,
which underscore with abundant clarity our incapacity for the
necessary work, we shall be able to disturb or to frustrate the work
of the powerful World Zionist Congress, that goes from strength to
strength?  That organization which appeared twenty three years ago
(1897) and took hold like a flame on the face of the land in every
place where the heart of a Jew beats; it fashioned a world platform
for the Jewish people that drew the attention of the heads of
governments to the Jewish question and, even before the war began the
effort on behalf of the Land of Israel whose fruits it is harvesting
today.  That organization which  was capable of appearing before the
League of Nations as the lawful representative of world Jewry and
succeeded in turning the state of war to the advantage of the holy
and just cause of its people so that the peace conference unanimously
recognized the land of Israel as the Jewish national home under the
protection of Great Britain.  Do those Hareidim really believe that
they will be able, through the veto power and through the
organizational power of the Agudah, which seems to lack any program,
to hold back the movement to build the land of Israel, which the
Zionist organization supports, without the support and even against
the will of the Hareidim,  with superior and ample means?  And if
they believe this, do they also believe that in opposition to the
flowering of the new Judaism in the land of Israel they will be able
to survive here in the Diaspora within the framework of their policy
of opposition?</FONT></P>

self-separation and dissociation from the new enthusiastic Judaism
that is in the land of Israel they will be able to merit those
achievements that they achieved in Hungary and Germany against the
Neologs?  If so, they do not understand the situation at all, because
while in the struggle with the Neologs, who had assimilationist
tendencies and whose objective was foreign to Judaism, they had an
easy contest.  But here they will have an encounter with organized
Judaism full of enthusiasm that sees Judaism in its image and aspires
to gather under the wings of Judaism those who have fallen or who
have fallen partially.  Against the influence of these the Hareidim
will not be able to guard their children even here in the Diaspora.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>	And as to the manner in which Talmud will be studied in
the land of Israel, a reduction in the number of those who study
Talmud need arouse no fears, for the present situation is not healthy
and is in the category of a deplorable necessity.  The healthy and
the natural doctrine is the following which was mentioned by the
Mishnah in Avot, that we cited above and is implied by the Midrash in
Midrash Rabbah at the beginning of Leviticus (chapter 2):</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is Ephraim a beloved son unto me?&quot; (Jeremiah
31:19): Israel stand as precious to me.  In the normal course of the
world a thousand people begin the study of the Scriputre, and one
hundred complete this course study.  These hundred begin the study of
the Mishnah, and ten complete this course of study.   These ten begin
the study of Talmud and one completes this course of study.  This is
the one about whom it is written (Ecclesiastes 7:28): &quot;One man
out of a thousand have I found.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	What a golden fruit would this doctrine yield in the
land of Israel.  The entire people, more or less, would be involved
in the study of the Holy Scriptures, and a not inconsiderable portion
would also be engaged in the study of the oral torah that is
organized in the Mishnah, while the students who distinguish
themselves in the study of Mishnah would be selected to devote
themselves to the study of Talmud.  From these would emerge true
Torah scholars and giants of Torah, similar to those whom we knew in
the bright era of Israel.  Even without this, the situation in the
land of Israel would be more healthy and more natural if only a small
portion of the people will turn to Torah studies at the highest
level, that is Talmudic study.  It would be healthy and natural if
higher Talmudic studies would be reserved to a small portion of the
people, in the manner in which the tribe of Levi, which constituted
eight percent of the people and did not participate in the ownership
of the land and whose assignment and profession was to be the
spiritual leaders of the nation, was sanctified and separated from
the people to devote themselves to the study of Torah at the highest
level.  In contrast the other tribes, which constituted 92 percent of
the people took part in various mundane occupations and were only
free on the Sabbath and Holy Days to provide their souls with
spiritual and moral nourishment.</FONT></P>

themselves to the study of Torah, because they had no other worries. 
The Holy One Blessed Be He replied to the Torah: &quot;I have another

<FONT SIZE=3>Besides its religious meaning, the commandment of the
first fruits, also had an additional purpose:  to encourage the
people working tills their land to a more intensive and more
exquisite cultivation of their crops.  This was like a religious vow.
 And the Mishnah in tractate of Bikurim tells us with what ceremony
of crowds and musical accompaniment the first fruits were brought up
to Jerusalem.  All the artisans, before whom those carrying the first
fruits passed, stood up and ceased working as a sign of respect to
the carriers of the first fruits, even though they were not obligated
to stand even for a Torah scholar.  To such an extent was
agricultural work venerated!  The simple farmer, whose diligent care
for his land served not only himself and his family, but the whole
nation, was accordingly so greatly uplifted and refined in his Jewish
consciousness and his character that he was not required to come to
the house of study except on the Sabbath and on Holy Days.  But when
Moses our teacher foresaw with the eyes of his spirit the image of
the Jew of the Diaspora who would have only the egoistic goal of his
own personal well-being in view and whose heart and mind, detached
from his land and unsure of his sustenance, would have no thought but
to profit at the expense of others, Moses was obliged to provide him
with a moral safeguard by sending him three times a day to the house
of worship so that he would not be overwhelmed by mundane, selfish
work.</FONT></P>

Their efforts were unnecessary, for the fear of heaven associated
with an easy life is very far from being powerful enough to resist

 At the commandment of the Almighty, blessed be He, Adam was
prohibited at pain of death from deriving any benefit from the Tree
of Knowledge.  He was, of course, one who feared Heaven, but he was
idle in the Garden of Eden.  So he was unable to withstand the test,
eating the fruit of the tree from which was commanded not to eat. 
And he said (Genesis 3:12): &quot;The woman that you gave to me.  She
gave me from the fruit of the tree.  And I ate.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>

your brow shall you eat bread.&quot;   The saying that one who
derives benefit from his own effort is greater than one who fears
Heaven is therefore exceedingly correct, for one who works is better
protected from sin than one who fears heaven but is idle, for the
latter is more easily caught by the tests of sin, and especially in
the matter of dealing honestly in business.  See the Midrash on
Proverbs</FONT></P>

to enter into this topic too deeply.  It is clear that the holy Torah
cannot put insurmountable obstacles in our way, so that we should be
unable to live our national life in our land and that we should be
required to remain in the Diaspora.  There can be no doubt that had
Israel remained in its homeland for the past two thousand years, it
would not have been capable of being closed off from advancements in
all areas of life.  As a wise and understanding nation, the people of
Israel would have been required to light the path before the nations
in these fields, too.  We can be sure that if we return now, after
two thousand years of exile, to live our national lives in our
homeland, that the Holy One Blessed Be He will give, and from the
midst of the people there will arise, leaders worthy of their great
assignment who will know how to reconcile life with the laws of the
Torah in the manner in which the Rambam posited in his commentary on
the Mishnah at the beginning of Sanhedrin.</FONT></P>

agreement among all the scholars to advance one man from the academy

have mentioned, that this takes place in the land of Israel, then the
academy will be established for this man and he will be ordained.  He
will then be able to ordain whomever he wants to.  For if you will
say otherwise, it is impossible that the Sanhedrin will never be
extant, because it is necessary that each member of the Sanhedrin be
ordained and the Holy One Blessed Be He promised that they would
return as it is written (Isaiah 1:26): &quot;And I shall return your
judges as at first and your counselors as in the beginning.  And then
it will be called unto you a city of justice.&quot;  And without
doubt this will occur when the Blessed Creator will prepare the

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Doubts similar to those that exist today in relation to
Zionism existed at all stages of the extension of rights to all Jews
in the Diaspora.  After the French Revolution, when the nations
reached the conclusion that it is not possible to deny an entire
people their natural rights of citizenship on account of their faith
and they granted the Jews the rights of equals, there were those of
our Hareidi teachers of that generation who expressed the most
serious religious reservations and attempted, by all means, to
prevent this process.  The same thing also happened again when the
question of the Hertzaphtzion recognition<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
in Hungary was solved, a matter to which I was an eyewitness.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It is worth remarking, by the way, on the historical
fact that the motivation for the solution of the question of
recognition in Hungary came from Klausenburg.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
 When the Tisza party, the party of liberalism, appeared on the
scene, it seemed an appropriate time to remove the shame of &quot;lack
of recognition&quot; from our ancient and honorable faith.  I,
together with two of the most distinguished Jewish citizens of the
city, explained to candidates of the Tisza party, who sought to
assure for themselves the support of Jewish voters, that the
government could not rely on the Jewish voters unless the prime
minister would announce publically and in an appropriate way, that
the government intended to propose in the near future legislation
concerning the recognition of the Jewish religion.  Shortly
thereafter such an announcement was indeed made by the prime
minister, and a short time later the recognition law was enacted by
the parliament.  This effort of mine was not well received in our
circles and my favor departed from the eyes of our Orthodox leaders.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	However, then as now, my position was this: even if we
should admit that emancipation and reciprocity contain within them
certain dangers for complete faith, this presumption cannot serve as
a reason to ascribe to the people an intention to forego, or even to
reject, natural rights.  &quot;Her ways are the ways of
pleasantness,&quot; not the ways of unnatural rejection.  The Holy
One Blessed Be He does not demand of people to cease being people,
nor does He demand of them that they quell their ambitions for
success in anticipation of dangers that are liable to endanger the
completeness of their faith</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Now happiness and wealth may become a great danger to
piety, as is explained in many places in the Scripture and as every
day life experience teaches us.  It would therefore have been
necessary, on account of the dangers within it, to impose a religious
prohibition against the ambition for happiness.  But we see that it
is not so, and not only do the pious among us pray for wealth and
honor, but they pursue with full energy the enlargement of their
wealth and possessions and they do not worry about bad results. 
There is no explanation except this:  that a Divine law cannot
prohibit or stop this tendency without at the same time impairing the
natural development of the human species.  More than this do we find:
Hezekiah the king ceased conjugal relations after he was informed
that he would beget a son named Menashe who would erect an idol in
the Holy Temple (2 Kings 41:7; 2 Chronicles 33:7).  He was then told
by Isaiah the prophet: &quot;What have you to do with these secrets
of the Merciful One?&quot;  (Berahot 10a).  &quot;Such worries are
not for you, and you ought not follow precautionary measures like
these.&quot;  Similarly, Miriam the daughter of Amram reproved her
father for leaving his wife in order not to beget a son to be drowned
in the Nile.  (Sotah 12a)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	If it is so for individuals, why would the Holy One
Blessed Be He demand of a whole people a self-denial that would be
like deliberate self-destruction?  Even if our holy Torah demands
from us not to depart from her ways, in the face either of
persecution or enticement by the Gentiles, even if she demands that
we sacrifice for her survival all, even our own selves, that is
precious to us, the Torah would not demand what is unnatural:  to
reject, owing to fear of ourselves, rights and advantages that are
otherwise attainable.  The first demand is humane and natural while
the second is inhumane and unnatural.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	In that manner, there is today an absurd opinion that
we the Hareidim must not exercise our right that has been recognized
by the Great Powers of the world, which have taken an extra step
forward by expressing their readiness to support the return of the
Jewish people to their ancient homeland, wherein the people will be
able to live in accord with their spirit and their tradition, because
we are afraid that there in the land of Israel, we will not, under
our own autonomous jurisdiction, be sufficiently devout.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT SIZE=3>	There is a further aspect to this question.  A
fundamental tenet of our faith is that even if people, in general,
are free in their actions and are not under the influence of a
celestial power, this is not so concerning great and significant
events that determine the destiny of entire nations.  In these cases,
the active agents are only puppets manipulated from above, because
the events that determine the destiny of the world cannot depend on
the will of an individual or of the many as it is written (Proverbs
21:1): &quot;The heart of kings and princes is in the hand of the
L-rd, whatever He wants they shall give.&quot;  Who among us would
dispute that the appearance twenty-six years ago of the Zionist
movement, which brought about the Balfour Declaration and the
recognition of the land of Israel as the homeland of the people of
Israel, was not decreed by Divine Providence?  </FONT>

considered utopian, does anything require to continue their rejection
today, after the world war and the subsequent peace conference have
transformed it into a reality?  Does anything require our Hareidim,
who see in every inconsequential event miracles and wonders, to view
precisely this phenomenon, which has astonished the world, as a mere
coincidence?  I am unable, and certainly do not want, to believe such
a thing.  I would rather hope that even in the twelfth hour a
decisive turning point will occur in the view of these leaders of
ours.  And would that this essay will makes its contribution to this.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>So should a man be.  Even should he encounter the
wicked, let him not be cruel</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"> but
he should have mercy upon them and say they are after all the
children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. If they are unworthy, their

<FONT FACE="Garamond, serif">So should a person be benevolent to
everyone and no man should be disgraced in his presence, but even the
most insignificant of creatures should be very important in his eyes
and he should focus on it and should provide for everyone who
requires his benevolence. And this will follow from his always being
peaceful toward all people, for if his conduct is harsh toward
people, they will not be reconciled to him. And this is the meaning
of the Mishnah (Avot 2:23):  &quot;Whoever is pleasing to mankind is
pleasing to the Omnipresent One.&quot; That his ears should always be
directed toward hearing good, but if he hears falsehood or
unpleasantness, he should not go into it at all.  And he should never
be angry, but he should only exhibit vitality and goowill to fulfill
every request and to support the downtrodden, to always forgive sins
and never to be angry with those who do wrong to him.  He should
always be conciliatory and seek kindness to provide satisfaction to
all.  He should train himself to bring the love of mankind into his
heart, even the wicked, as if they were his brothers until he fixes
in his heart the love of all mankind and he should love even the
wicked in his heart. (Chap. 2) </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Garamond, serif">	If our leaders took these holy words of
gold to heart, they would know how to save true Judaism in a
different fashion from that of isolation, for then, by actions
intended to advance the physical well-being of the nation, they would
be able to conquer the hearts of the unbelievers.  And through the
power of that love they could turn the ears of the children of their
nation to their words, just as we know that Aaron the Priest, a lover
and pursuer of peace, and a lover of mankind, brought them closer to
Torah. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	However, if the rabbis are concerned only with the soul, and have no
interest in the physical well-being or the pain of the people, then
it may be inferred that, because the prosperity of the people would
cause them to lose their status, they see the salvation of the people
and the deliverance of the Torah that has been entrusted to their
hands as consisting entirely and solely in separation and division. 
See the Talmud in Berakhot (28a) where R. Joshua said to R. Gamliel:
&quot;Woe unto the generation for which you are the benefactor, for
you do not know of the distress of the Torah scholars.&quot;  And see
the Rambam who says that a Torah scholar must always be distressed
and worried about the troubles of Israel and must join in their
distress.  Similarly, instead of taking responsibility upon
themselves for the religious condition of the people, as it is
written (Deuteronomy 1:13), &quot;and I will appoint them as your
heads,&quot; from which our Sages deduced that the guilt of a
generation hangs over the heads of the leaders (Deuteronomy Rabbah
1), and as the Holy One Blessed Be He said to Moses (Exodus 32:7):
&quot;go down for your people have corrupted themselves&quot; which
meant &quot;go down from your greatness, I did not give you any
greatness except for Israel&quot; - instead of this, they compound
the transgression and encourage intolerance and stir up the rage of
division.

The Mizrahi wishes to enact the laws of the Torah by its own

	To reinforce this position, your rabbinical court announced
subsequently that such a practice would violate the Torah.  However,
I allow myself to present a modest question to the rabbinical court:
On what basis do you nullify the will of the people, when the holy
Torah turns over to the authority of the people the choice of a king
and even imposes upon it this function, as it is written in poroshat
Shophtim (Deuteronomy 17:15): &quot;you may indeed set a king over
you.&quot;  The only qualification that is required of the king is
that he be a Jew by nationality.  &quot;You may not put a foreigner
over you.&quot;  (See the Ramban on that verse.)  He represents the
will of people.  The priest and the prophet had no executive
authority.  Their task was to guide the king and the people by moral
means in the path of the Torah.  If these means were not effective,
the Holy One Blessed Be He reserved to Himself alone the function of
carrying it out, as the tokhahah takes into account the possibility
of moral reproof and exile.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Haman the wicked was noteworthy for Israel in being a more
significant source of reproof than the forty-eight prophets and seven

entire Written and Oral Torah that the Holy One Blessed Be He
commanded that nation be subject to reproof by an Orthodox, Agudist
association.</P>

	The proper path is the path of the Torah.  The Mizrahi, which aims
to influence the leaders and the people, through moral persuasion, to

	Nor does the Agudah appear to be serious, because more than eight
years passed since the Katowitz meeting,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
with no sign of life from the Agudah.  In the new program they
attempt to attribute this fact to the war that broke out twenty-seven
months later.  In the opinion of our Sages (Berahot 58b), a period of
twelve months is sufficient for the most precious matters to be
forgotten.  A period of a year is enough for deceased parents to be
forgotten.  A year after the passing of her husband, a widow may
marry another man.  But what happened to the enthusiasm of the
Katovits meeting?  How did they fill the vacuum of this period of
time?  Why could they not call within a year a planned international
conference?  And how were their efforts expressed to minimize the
suffering and hardship, the terror of which cannot be described, that
came during the World War, and especially upon the Jewish people? 
How small is the Agudah and how negligible are its achievements in
comparison to those of the Zionist leadership, both in the political

	Please remember, my lord, that in every place in which pogroms and
pillage were carried out, they were stopped or restrained only
through the great influence of the Zionist administration, the
national representative of the Jewish people in the great League of
Nations.  It has now been told to me that in Nasaud and other small
towns in Transylvania that the Romanian government stopped the
looting populace by taking into consideration that the Jews had
gained great influence in the Peace Conference and that looting the
property of the Jews would damage Romanian interests at this
conference.  Even Graf Apponyi of Hungary testified on the great
influence of the Jews and he therefore weakened and minimized the
atrocities against the Jews.</P>

	What can the Agudah show in comparison to this?  Nothing of the
Agudah's opposition program for the land of Israel has been
disclosed.  Does it wish to set up, as a shadow government, Orthodox
trains, telegraphs, and post offices?  Or does it propose to organize
a special police force for the Orthodox and similar services, and to
gain for this purpose the permission of the English government?  And
what does it wish to do in the Diaspora?  Does it wish to seek
special minority rights for the Orthodox?  Or perhaps it wants, on
the example of the Orthodox in Czechoslovakia and Transylvania, to
forego any claims on the relevant governments for minority national
rights, and only to gain special recognition?  As long as the Agudah
does not clarify these questions, it cannot hope to be joined by
serious and clear-thinking people.</P>

	Finally, I wish to conclude with a word of encouragement for the
Hareidim of the Mizrahi in the belief that we are now living in the
time of the Salvation and that our work is holy work.  For this

The salvation from Egypt was not strong and durable enough to last
for eternity because it was a salvation achieved by ravaging nature
through miracles and signs and wonders.  But a miracle has no

should not be placed in the human, but one should know that it came
from the Eternal to enlighten his heart to do good, just as the
Eternal enlightened the spirit of Cyrus that he should send the
