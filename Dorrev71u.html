          scholarship and distinguished lineage gave R. Moshe Shmuel
          considerable latitude to take controversial stands in such

          opposition of the Hungarian Orthodox rabbinate.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the First
          World Mizrahi Congress was held in Pressburg in 1904, most of

          secular Zionism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost
          the only Hungarian rabbi at the Congress, R. Moshe Shmuel, in
          a memorable address, defended both Zionism and Mizrahi,
          rebuking those who portrayed the effort to reestablish the
          Jewish homeland as inimical to Orthodoxy.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Estranged from his
          colleagues in the Hungarian rabbinate, R. Moshe Shmuel endured
          the unbridled vilification and rage of the extreme
          anti-Zionists in defiant isolation -- but never in silence.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He spoke out
          ceaselessly on behalf of Zionism and Mizrahi, and shortly
          before his departure for Israel, he wrote a final work on
          Zionism and faith, arguing that it was the anti-Zionists who,
          in denying the national aspect of Judaism, had deviated from
          Orthodox principles.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5"

          tractate of <i>Hulin</i>, especially the commandment to

          raises the question how the Israelites had eaten meat during
          the forty years in the desert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Rashi and the other classical commentators, following
          the opinion of R. Ishmael recorded in <i>Hulin</i> 16b-17a,
          assert that the consumption of <i>hulin</i> had been
          prohibited until Deuternonomy 12:20-21 lifted the prohibition.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem is that
          R. Akiva maintains that <i>hulin</i> had been permitted
          without <i>sh’hitah</i> until entry into Canaan, and the
          halakhah (as codified by Rambam in <i>Hilkhot Sh’hitah</i>

          and interpretation of the verses seem incomprehensible, which

          Shmuel stated (<i>Dor Revi’i</i> <i>hakdamah</i> 5b) that his

          particularly stressed the cardinal importance of carefully
          reading the text of the Rambam, because the Rambam's
          interpretation of a <i>sugya</i> often differed from that of
          Rashi or the <i>Tosafot</i>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Assuming
          that the Rambam must have interpreted a <i>sugya</i> as Rashi
          and the <i>Tosafot</i> had, later commentators often
          questioned his codifications in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But once we uncover

          Moshe Shmuel argued, were misplaced, because the supposed
          inconsistencies arise from the false assumption that the
          Rambam interpreted the <i>sugyot</i> in question as did the
          other <i>Rishonim</i> (“<i>ki mei-ikara ein hathalah l-shum

          bring to mind the approach of Rabbi Haim Soloveitchik.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The affinity
          between their methods of Talmudic analysis may account for the

          R. Moshe Shmuel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It

          R. Moshe Shmuel addressed the question of why the Almighty
          found it necessary to divide the Torah into a Written and an
          Oral part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
          novel contention was that the purpose of the Oral Law was to
          allow the judges and sages of each generation to adapt the
          halakhah to contemporary circumstances.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This adaptability
          was sanctioned by the Written Law (Deuteronomy 17:9-12), which
          gave the judges of each generation unlimited discretion to
          overturn the halakhic decisions of earlier judges (Rambam, <i>Hilkhot

            Mamrim</i> 2:1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;mso-pagination:
        widow-orphan"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">It was to preserve
          this adaptability that writing down the Oral Law had
          originally been forbidden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>As long as it was transmitted only by word of mouth, no
          single version of the Oral Law was authoritative.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, a
          decision of the Sanhedrin was binding.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the Sanhedrin
          itself was not constrained by the textual interpretations or
          halakhic decisions of its predecessors.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The principle of <i>stare

            decisis</i> could not constrain the Sanhedrin, because the
          Torah gave absolute authority to the “judge that will be those
          days.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A written
          text of the Oral Law, necessarily embodying a particular set
          of interpretations of the Written Law, would have greatly

            yes">&nbsp; </span>When offering the Torah to the
          descendants of Esau, Ishmael, and Amon, God spoke to their
          sages, explaining that they would receive both a Written and
          an Oral Law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon

          learning that the Torah consisted of both a Written Law and an
          Oral Law whose content they could change by reinterpreting the
          Written Law, their sages realized that the national characters
          of their peoples precluded accepting the Torah.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With complete
          freedom to interpret the Written Law, they would ultimately
          infuse their national vices into their interpretations.<span

          the spirit of the Law would be perverted even if its letter
          were preserved, they properly refused God’s offer.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor is the blessing
          over the Torah inconsistent with the Midrash, because only
          after determining that the Jewish people alone could safely be

          </span>"When Moses saw that the Holy Temple would be
          destroyed, and the <i>bikurim</i> would be canceled, he rose
          and enacted three daily prayers for the Jewish people."<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides the
          religious meaning of the commandment of <i>bikurim</i>, there
          was an added purpose:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to

          spur the people working their land to<span

          more exquisite care of their tillage.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This care was like
          a religious vow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The

          Mishnah in <i>Bikurim</i> (3:4-5) tells us with what ceremony
          of crowds and musical accompaniment the <i>bikurim</i> were
          brought up to Jerusalem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>All the artisans before whom the carriers of the <i>bikurim</i>
          passed, stood up and ceased working as a sign of respect for
          the carriers of the <i>bikurim</i>, even though they were not
          obligated to stand for a Torah scholar.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To such an extent
          was agricultural work venerated!<span style="mso-spacerun:
            yes">&nbsp; </span>The recognition of the simple farmer,
          whose diligent care for his land serves not only himself and
          his family, but the whole nation, uplifts and refines his
          Jewish recognition and character so greatly that he did not
          have to attend the house of worship except on the Sabbath and
          on Holy Days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But

          when Moses saw . . . the image of the Jew in the Diaspora, who
          would have only the selfish goal of his personal welfare
          before his eyes, and, separated from his land and unsure of
          his livelihood, would have no thought but to profit at others’
          expense, Moses had to provide him with a moral safeguard.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So he sent him
          three times a day to the house of prayer in order that he not
          be immersed in mundane selfish work (<i>Ha-Tsionut b-Or
            ha-Emunah</i>, 71-72).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          led R. Moshe Shmuel to argue that universal principles of good
          and bad and right and wrong can override even an explicit
          prohibition of the Torah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>For example, while there are <i>d-oraita</i>
          prohibitions against wearing a garment made of <i>shatnez</i>
          and against wearing a garment designed for the opposite sex,
          R. Moshe Shmuel insisted (<i>p'tihah</i> 26b) that
          transgressing those prohibitions is preferable to appearing
          naked in public (which would violate no <i>d-oraita</i>
          prohibition) if one had no other garments with which to clothe
          himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
          eating human flesh, though not explicitly prohibited, is worse
          than eating <i>n'veilah</i> or <i>treifah</i>.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Whatever is

          style="font-size:11.0pt">even if it has not been specifically

            ha-Shem</i> . . . , but because whatever is prohibited to
          the Noahides cannot be permissible to us because of the
          principle "Is there something [which is prohibited to them but
          not to us]” (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 59a).<span style="mso-spacerun:
            yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for a dangerously sick person, the
          consumption of human flesh or spoiled <i>n'veilah</i> is
          certainly a more serious offense than the consumption of <i>heilev</i>
          or <i>tevel</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
          statement in <i>Yoma</i> 83a that it is preferable to feed <i>n'veilah</i>
          than to feed <i>tevel</i> to a dangerously sick person must
          be referring to <i>n'veilah</i> through an improper <i>sh'hitah</i>,
          but not to <i>n'veilah</i> from natural causes, the
          consumption of which is prohibited by the general laws of
          morality and decency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
          it is well known that the flesh of an animal that died of
          natural causes is dangerous, so how could one imagine that the
          sages would have commanded to give to a sick person meat that
          is spoiled and fit for dogs rather than <i>tevel</i> that was
          not prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And

          anyone who denies this diminishes the honor of the Torah and
          causes it to be said of us "a foolish and depraved nation"

          come to object that it is difficult to say that a man is
          obligated to become destitute . . . rather than save what he
          owns by transgressing a negative prohibition . . . Constant
          poverty for all one's days, which is an unending torment, is
          much harsher than taking a life.<span style="mso-spacerun:

          monetary compulsion is not true compulsion (<i>ones mamon lav

            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly if a
          healthy and strong person with a job to support himself and
          his family, lost all his wealth, he would suffer only the pain
          of losing money, which would not be a matter of life or death.<span

          or sick person, whose livelihood depended on his property and
          possessions, lost his possessions, it would destroy his life,
          because he could no longer support himself and his family
          except from charity and casting himself upon the public.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, his
          wealth is, by law, more precious to him than his life, because
          for him death is better than the pain of poverty.<span

            </span>Separation of the communities was allowed by the
            Imperial government in 1869, at the behest of the leading
            Hungarian Orthodox rabbis, after the non-Orthodox faction
            took control of the official religious institutions in many
            cities and suppressed Orthodox practices in the name of

            Tsivia might not survive the journey to Palestine or the

            rejected such advice, insisting that it was inconceivable

            </span>Even if the monetary interpretation of the verse was
            divinely transmitted to Moses, since the interpretation
            could be derived from hermeutic principles, it is not clear
            that, under the principles of <i>lo ba-shamayim hi</i> and
            <i>lo tasur,</i> a later court could not have overriden that

            that it is permissible to kill maggots despite a general
            prohibition against killing living creatures on the Sabbath,
